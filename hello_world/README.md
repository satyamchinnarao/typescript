# README: Compiling and Running TypeScript

This README provides instructions on how to compile and run TypeScript code using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) and execute the generated JavaScript code in Node.js.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- TypeScript (installed globally or locally in your project)

## Installation
If you haven't installed TypeScript globally, you can do so via npm:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
 ```
## Compiling TypeScript
1. **Create TypeScript File**: Create a `.ts` file containing your TypeScript code. For example, `index.ts`.
2. **Compile TypeScript**: Open your terminal (command prompt) and navigate to the directory containing your TypeScript file.
   Run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) followed by TypeScript file:
  
  ```bash
  tsc  index.ts
  ```

This command compiles `index.ts` into JavaScript, generating `index.js`.

## Running JavaScript
After compiling TypeScript to JavaScript, you can execute the generated JavaScript code using Node.js or in a browser environment.

### Running in Node.js
1. **Execute JavaScript**: In your terminal, run the following command to execute the JavaScript file generated by the TypeScript compiler:

```bash
node index.js
```
